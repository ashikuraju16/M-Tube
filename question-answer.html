          1.Discuss the scope of var,let,and const ?
        </h2>

          <span class="text-3xl font-extrabold text-green-900">Ans:</span> var
          is function-scoped, accessible throughout the function it's declared
          in. let and const are block-scoped, limited to the block they're
          defined in. let allows <span class="ml-[64px]">reassignment</span>,
          while const creates immutable bindings. All three are hoisted to the
          top of their scope.

          2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-2xl font-medium">
          <span class="text-3xl font-extrabold text-green-900"> Ans:</span> null
          is explicitly assigned to indicate the absence of a value. It's used
          to represent intentional absence. undefined typically signifies an
          unintentional absence, <span class="ml-[64px]">like</span> when a
          variable is declared but not assigned a value. Both help manage data
          integrity and error handling in JavaScript applications.

        <h2>3.What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
        <p>
          <span>Ans:</span> A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a
          software architectural style for designing networked applications. It
          uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
          operations on resources, employing standard HTTP methods like GET,
          POST, PUT, DELETE. It emphasizes stateless communication and
          resource-based interactions between clients and servers.
